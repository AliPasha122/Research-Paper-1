Radio Frequency switches are widely used in
commercial, aerospace and defense applications. These include
satellite communication systems, wireless communication and
radar systems. In order to select an appropriate RF switch for
any application, one must first consider the required
performance specifications such as frequency bandwidth,
power handling capability, signal level, switching speed, power
consumption and tolerable losses. RF MEMS (Micro-ElectroMechanical-System) technology offers the necessary
performance advantages over existing solid-state options. A
design of DC contact RF MEMS shunt switch is proposed in
this paper. The design is optimized in terms of activation
mechanism which includes switch hinge thickness, bridge
thickness, air gap height and number of menders. The pull-in
voltage is analyzed with commercial CAD finite element
analysis software IntelliSuite.
